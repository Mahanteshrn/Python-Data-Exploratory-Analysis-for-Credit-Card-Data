Discussion 

ANALYTICS IN CREDIT CARD INDUSTRY:

Analytics has penetrated every industry owing to the various technology platforms that
collect information and thus, the service providers know what exactly customers want. The
Credit Card industry is no exception. Within credit card payment processing, there is a
significant amount of data available that can be beneficial in countless ways.  

Understanding the customer behaviour

The data available from a credit card processor identifies the types of consumers and their
business spending behaviors. Hence, developing the marketing campaigns to directly
address their behaviors indeed grows the revenue and these considerations will result in
greater sales. 

Personalize offering based on data results

Data also reveals specific interests and needs in individual customers that a company can
leverage, this addressing their needs more efficiently. Specific promotions can be sent out
related to where these customers are located and this builds sales more quickly.

Use trends and patterns to get new customers

The transactions and activities of the existing customers that they do in terms of purchase
behavior tends to reflect larger trends that are coming. This information provides a strategy
to go after possible customers in the target audience. 
Uncover suspicious activity

The data from credit card processing is becoming increasingly important as a tool to fight
fraud. When combined with artificial intelligence, this data is being analyzed quickly to
uncover areas of purchase activity. 
Reduce chargebacks

The ability to detect suspicious activity and patterns in data can also assess whether or not a
transaction might result in a chargeback. Using analytics to track each transaction reveals
anomalies. This information can help you reject that transaction and save your business
from chargebacks.
